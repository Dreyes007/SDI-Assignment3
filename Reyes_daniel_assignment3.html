<p>The theme for this project is a continuation of the story on project 2 in which me and my friend had obtained and had a lot of fun with a wild horse.</p>
<p>This horse was tamed enough to ride but it had one problem, it didn't know how to stop.  When I got on the horse, it would trot normally and if I tapped him on the side it would trot faster, but once I pulled on the ropes to make it stop it would actually start galloping really fast and uncontrollably till the point that I had to jump off the horse.</p>
<p>Later on, me and my friends figured out that the only way to make the horse stop was to actually cover his eyes.</p>
